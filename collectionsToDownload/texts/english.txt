ABOUT CONSENT

One thing at a time
There is no "should"
There is no "must"
Free to change your mind at any time
Infinite possibility
Start, stop, switch
Try it and see
Fuck gender roles
There is no end point
And, or, as well


ASKING

Would you like...?
What do you want to happen now?
How are you doing?
Or...?
Are you sure?


SAYING YES

Yes!
Let's go!
I'd like to
I want to


SAYING NO

No
Maybe later
Can we take a break?
Hold back if you are unsure


SAYING I'M NOT SURE

Maybe
Hmmmmm
I'm not sure
