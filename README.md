# No-Dotted-Line
Images for making an illustrated book on healthy consent.

NO DOTTED LINE is a remixable sex ed book about healthy consent. It's made of lavish illustrations, created with libre graphics software, and every visual element is available for remixing and re-use. In good consent there is no "dotted line", no final deal - all is provisional; iterations are welcome as desires shift. This illustrated book likewise has no final version, and evolves with the instincts of its reader-writers. The project demonstrates a libre workflow in all senses of the word - promiscuous, consensual design created with free software and released for re-use. http://eleanorg.org/no-dotted-line

## Suggestions for playing with the images 
These SVG illustrations are designed for layering & remixing. 
Some text suggestions are provided in the 'collections to download' folder as captions for the images. See below for further ideas on how you cn play with the images and contribute your own.

If you know how to use a vector graphics editor you could improve or add new graphics to the project. Would be nice if you are using a free libre open source software like Inkscape. It is cross platform software, meaning that it and you can install it to a computer that is using Windows, GNU/Linux or Mac operating systems. download it here: inkscape.org.

Some body shapes are a single path, others are made of a group of paths with different colours. To change colours of grouped paths in Inkscape, click on a body shape then SHIFT + CTRL + G to ungroup it, and edit each colour separately.

To create a 'cutout' of a shape for layering, put one path on top of another, select both, then Path > Difference will punch a hole in one which has the shape of the other.

## Host a sex ed session about healthy consent
You can use host a workshop using the content of the book: feel free to download the images, perhaps to make cut-outs which participants can rearrange.
