SVG images are designed for layering & remixing. 
Some text suggestions are provided in the 'collections to download' folder as captions for the images.

## Suggestions for playing with the images in Inkscape
Click on a body shape then SHIFT + CTRL + G to ungroup it, and edit each limb separately.
To create a 'stencil' for layering, put one path on top of another, select both, then Path > Difference will punch a hole in one which has the shape of the other.
