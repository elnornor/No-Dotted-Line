# No-Dotted-Line
Files for making an illustrated book on healthy consent.

These SVG illustrations are designed for layering & remixing. 
Some text suggestions are provided in the 'collections to download' folder as captions for the images.

## To contribute your remixes
Please submit pull request to pageSpreads folder. Images should be in portrait or landscape format, A4 page size. Number your image file one greater than the highest page number already in the folder, in this format: page05.svg

## Suggestions for playing with the images in Inkscape
Some body shapes are a single path, others are made of a group of paths with different colours. To change colours of grouped paths, click on a body shape then SHIFT + CTRL + G to ungroup it, and edit each colour separately.

To create a 'cutout' of a shape for layering, put one path on top of another, select both, then Path > Difference will punch a hole in one which has the shape of the other.
