## Suggestions for playing with the images 
If you know how to use a vector graphics editor you could improve or add new graphics to the project. Would be nice if you are using a free libre open source software like Inkscape. It is cross platform software, meaning that it and you can install it to a computer that is using Windows, GNU/Linux or Mac operating systems. download it here: inkscape.org.

Some body shapes are a single path, others are made of a group of paths with different colours. To change colours of grouped paths in Inkscape, click on a body shape then SHIFT + CTRL + G to ungroup it, and edit each colour separately.

To create a 'cutout' of a shape for layering, put one path on top of another, select both, then Path > Difference will punch a hole in one which has the shape of the other.

## Host a sex ed session about healthy consent
You can use host a workshop using the content of the book: feel free to download the images, perhaps to make cut-outs which participants can rearrange. 


## To contribute your remixes
Please submit pull request to pageSpreads folder. Images should be in portrait or landscape format, A4 page size. Number your image file one greater than the highest page number already in the folder, in this format: page05.svg
